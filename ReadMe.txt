The app is called Odysseus, a traveler's diary


Build:
    This product has no special instruction for building. To build the product, just simply open the file "Odysseus.xcodeproj" under the directory "Odysseus_CSCI321FinalProject/Odysseus" by Xcode, and build within Xcode.

Analyzer:
    This product could go through the analyzer without any warning.

Device compatibility:

    Hardware compatibility
        The real hardware we've tested including iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6S, iPhone SE, iPad Pro (12), iPad Pro (9.7), iPad Air, all of which worked

        Based on the fact that our code is universal, the product would be able to run on all types of simulators. 

        We designed this product with a focus on 4 inches or larger iPhones and iPads. Although our product could run on a 3.5-inch simulator without errors, we would not say it is fully compatible, since we do not have real hardware to test it on. 

    Rotation support
        Although we do not recommend using our product in landscape, this application does support rotation, and all functionalities perform normally.

    Project difficulty:
        We would say that the difficulty of developing this application is fair, although we've faced tons of wired warnings and errors that takes some time to sort out. The most challenging part is the Core data integration. Apple didn't provide a straight forward interface to deal with it. Then, we spent a lot of time to optimize our user interface design. 

        The time estimate for creating the app is around 10-12 hours per week, per person, which including designing, learning, and testing.

	Best Part:
         The best part of our application should be:
                     - 1: The user interface design
                     - 2: Integration of iCloud
                     - 3: Awesome UX (user experience) design and implementation
        Our project is not a simple technology combination, we care about users and use highly intensive technology to create a flawless user experience. It is an experience of "just work." 

    Unit test:
        We do include unit testing in our app. Sadly, we only have one data module, and it only contains one variable extraction method and initializers, so have only one single test on extracting variables.
